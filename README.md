There is a lot of data with a colon in the middle of each line. This data needs to be organized into a table for printing. The data before the colon will be placed in one column, while the data after the colon will be in another. Each line will be on a separate row. The data is in linuxcommands.txt. . This problem has been solved using Python in two ways. One writes the data to a docx file and the other writes it to HTML. The docx file is written to output.docx via writeOnDoc.py. And the HTML is written to output.html via readWrite.py.
